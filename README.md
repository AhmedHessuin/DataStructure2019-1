# Project Description
## Social Media Analysis
This projects aims to implement different analysis strategies to analize social networks for the *__Centrality__* property of the nodes(users) in the network, utilizing Graph theory and some of its related topics (ex: Single Source Shortest Path).
## Centrality
As its deffinition varies acording to the  *__criteria__* of interest we will generally define it here as "__The *Criteria* that defines the score of a particular node(user) in the network__". In this project three types of centrality(criteria) are implemented:

| Centrality Criteria | Definition           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Degree Centrality      |  Degree Centrality for a node is simply its __degree__, a node's degree is simply a count of how many social connections (i.e. edges) it has.|
| Closeness Centrality      | Closeness Centrality indicates how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. It is calculated as the average of the __shortest path__ length from the node to every other node in the network. |
| Betweenes Centrality |Betweenness Centrality measures the number of times a node lies on the __shortest path__ between other nodes.|

# Project Dependincies
## Programming Language Setup:
### JDK Setup:
1. Download and Install Java JDK version Java SE 8u191 / Java SE 8u192 ![here](https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/ "Java SE 8u191 / Java SE 8u192").
2. Configure Environment Variables:
  Start menu -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables.
3. Edit PATH variable and Add the path to the JRE bin folder. (ex: `C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_172\bin`)
4. Edit System variables and add a new variable with name JAVA_HOME and value set to the path of your JDK folder (ex: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_172`)
## Integrated development environment (IDE):
As For the IDE of choice it's the **Netbeans IDE 8.2** which can be downloaded at the official website's ![download page](https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/ "Download Netbeans 8.2").
